% temple_abm_cellular_game_of_life_file_ic.m located at

%
% ---Prompt---
% Use the Matlab file temple_abm_cellular_game_of_life_file_ic.m
% from the course website http://math.temple.edu/~seibold/teaching/2018_2100/
% to produce three interesting programs, named yourfamilyname_problem7a.m,
% yourfamilyname_problem7b.m, and yourfamilyname_problem7c.m,
% to be submitted as usual (i.e., email to the course instructor).
% Each  of  the  three  files  should  run  an  animation  of  Conwayâ€™s  Game  of  Life,  with  at  least  two  interesting
% objects interacting with each other in interesting ways, in the spirit of 
% the provided example of a glider gun shooting at a blinker ship.
% Take the structures from an online resource like the website
% http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/glossary.html (or other resources).
% Make sure to submit the corresponding *.txt files of the objects with your 
% codes.
% ---Implementation---
%   Implementation of Conway's Game of Life - Pompeii. 
%   "A cell remains alive if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, and a dead cell 
%   becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors. Otherwise cells die or
%   remain dead." 
%   Here is a cellular automata representation of the Mount Vesuvius eruption of
%   79 AD. A bi-gun is used to simulate lava rolling down the volcano and
%   lava shooting into the air: landing and flowing in certain
%   locations of the town bellow. I used the middleweight_volcano.txt for 
%   visual purposes. The volcano's actions are dictated by the bi-gun.
%   I use multiple twin_bees_shuttle.txt to simulate the citizens of Pompei 
%   going about their business before the lava disrupts their automation.
%   I used middleweight_volcano.txt and twin_bees_shuttle.txt from
%   http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/glossary.html.
%   I created the bi-gun in a .txt myself. I got the design from 
%   http://www.conwaylife.com/w/index.php?title=Bi-gun.
%   These files should be included in the working directory:
%   bi_gun.txt
%   middleweight_volcano.txt
%   twin_bees_shuttle.txt

% Parameters

pos{2} = [90,11]; % position of object loaded from file (top corner)
filename{3} = 'twin_bees_shuttle.txt';

% Construct initial configuration

    S = load_data_file(filename{j}); % road data file
    F(pos{j}(1)+(1:size(S,1)),... % add object
        pos{j}(2)+(1:size(S,2))) = S; % to 2d array
end

% Initialization
n = size(F); % new size of domain (if necessary)
shl1 = [n(1),1:n(1)-1]; shr1 = [2:n(1),1]; % shift index vectors in dim 1
shl2 = [n(2),1:n(2)-1]; shr2 = [2:n(2),1]; % shift index vectors in dim 2

% Computation
clf
for j = 0:3000 % time loop
    % Plotting
    imagesc(~F') % plot array of cells
    axis equal tight, caxis([0,1]), colormap(gray)
    title(sprintf('Eruption after %d steps',j))
    pause(1e-2+(j==0)) % wait a bit (and a bit more initially)
    % Update rule
    neighbors = F(shl1,shl2)+F(shl1,:)+F(shl1,shr2)+... % number
        F(:,shl2)+F(:,shr2)+... % of neighbors
        F(shr1,shl2)+F(shr1,:)+F(shr1,shr2); % for each cell
    F = (F&(neighbors==2|neighbors==3))|... % cell remains alive
        (~F&neighbors==3); % or cell becomes alive
